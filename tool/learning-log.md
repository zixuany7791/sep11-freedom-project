10/29/23 Main Goal: Setup Firebase

I followed the Net Ninja firebase tutorial to [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yNyiW_41H8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jERUGvbudErNCeSZHWUVlb&index=4) and I set up a database and I fetch the data from it. 
* Challenge: Testing firebase
  * I went from using `import()` to using `require()` and still didn't work
  * William helped me by saying that I am suppose to put `"type": "Module"` inside of the `<script>`
