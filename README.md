# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Zixuan Yu**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Firebase** in order to help me make **RiceGrades**, a grading website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Can motivate students to keep a high average on their grades.
##### CONS
* Not visually appealing
* Instructions may confuse users on how RiceGrades works
* There is no way for parents to communicate with the teacher in this website.
