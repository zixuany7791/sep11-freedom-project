# Entry 2: Learning Tools
##### 12/17/23

After selecting firebase as my tools, I continued watching [Net Ninja's Firebase Tutorial](#) and so far I have learned how to play around with the database such as fetching data from the database, adding and deleting documents on and not on the [website](#), etc.

With those knowledges, I decided to try to make some function that I will definitely need to make in my freedom project. So I worked on functions include fetching the data and display them to the HTML webpage and deleting document without document ID.

Firstly, I thought putting the data I fetched from the database on the HTML webpage will be easy but I was wrong.
