I am currently on the stage 8 of the Engineering Design Process, which is to communicate the result of the grading website in EXPO and In-class Presentation.

Compared to my last In-class Presentation about the freedom project, I truly believe that I have become much less stressed about this one. This improvement is not only because I have more experience presenting in front of a class by myself, but also because I have spent time practicing my presentation at home. However, I believe there are still areas I can improve on. For example, during the in-class presentation, I noticed that I repeated the benefits of Firebase when trying to describe what Firebase can do. This happened because I was coming up with sentences on the spot as I was presenting. I believe that next time, preparing an explantion in advance and trying to memorize it can help the presentation go more smoothly.

During the EXPO, I noticed that it is difficult to deliver my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19z769_mWgQ0U6uTKcJHUtl26YjSslUzbOPHizYspI68/edit#heading=h.i2r9vdne8gdz) that I have prepared because then my partners wouldn't have a chance to speak. Therefore we decided to assign roles to demo different section of the website where I am controling to teachers page and have one partner showing the database of the grading website and one showing the student page. My takeaway of this EXPO is that I should be more aware of my partners because I didn't think much of them when I prepared to elevator pitch.

Throughout [In-class Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iDwtYyNoZOTWqBq0-eZfyW1XwlIfCvrQiYxQs7fg9p0/edit#slide=id.p) and EXPO, I have practice many skills such as time management and communication. As a junior, coding grading website and preparing for presentation meanwhile having other projects and essays from other classes to complete is not a easy task. I have to stay up to finish them and sometimes even have to decide which one I would complete them after the due date. Therefore I believe that I need to have a better time management so that I can prevent more late assignments. In EXPO, me and my partners have adjusted and created an elevator pitch together after looking at each other's elevator pitch. I am glad that we communicate each other first before EXPO begins because that allows us to have equal chance to speak during presentation.
